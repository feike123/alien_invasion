# Alien Invasion
A game to shoot aliens

# Motivation:
I made this program for my python study

# Build status:
Complete

# Complication:
It was hard to figure out how to install and use pygame, you can't simply download the program. After a lot of searching on the internet I found out that I need to use the command center to install pygame, via the command "pip install pygame".
